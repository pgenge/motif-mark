pseudocode/brain dump/office hours notes


use onelinefasta to make a one line fasta sequence
then loop through each line and search for a motif sequence that is know from the motifs file
also take into account ambiguous motifs and take into account IUPAC

create exon, gene, and motif classes
ex. y = 300, 300 always the same can put it into our class data

functions
draw using pycairo for each class

Classes:
exon
  methods: identify an exon from a fasta sequence, identify a cassette
motif
  method: search for motifs and identify and search for ambiguous motifs
gene
  identify a gene from a fasta sequence

Fasta sequence line
Motifs from the motif file--this would interact with the following elements of a transcript
Cassette (exon that is alternatively spliced)
Exon
Intron
Something for helping to draw pycairo--this would interact with the motif class

exon1  = (start, stop, thickness, color) #can specify the color in 
motif = (start, stop, thickness, color) #hard to do with motif bc the colors will be different
gene = (0, 200, 1, black)
gene = line(0, 200, "gene") # bc it's always gonna be the same

Define object classes objects are nouns-just a template (instructions to build these objects) attributes (features-data), behaviours--method
easy to find the code, fix the bug, point to it etc.--need a legend



LAB NOTEBOOK-While coding notes

My oneline fasta doesn't work. CANNOT diagnose the problem--I have no idea why it's only writing out the headers
Adding IUPAC dictionary to bioinfo module for future use

replacing the motifs with just ambiguous motifs isn't working, it's replacing all of them and my list is too long?? so says Rachel lol
      OPE my append to the new list was inside the wrong for loop--resolved!

Someone showed me a way to make the relative widths and height but for some reason it doesn't work for how my code is set up, so putting this code chunk
to have for future reference
for loop for setting relative width and height won't work--hard coding for now.

#handle file to find longest line and get header to set context of cairo surface
# linecount = 0
# longest_seq = 0
# fasta_id = ""

#set context to be relative to the size of the number of lines in the fasta and the longest line length
# for line in fa:
#     linecount += 1
#     line = line.strip('\n')
#     #print(line)
#     if line == "":
#       break
#     # elif line.startswith('>'):
#     #    seq_id = line.strip('\n')
#     else:
#        line = line.strip('\n')
#        if len(line) > longest_seq:
#           longest_seq = len(line)


I do not understand regex at all--but it's working thanks to help from friends!
